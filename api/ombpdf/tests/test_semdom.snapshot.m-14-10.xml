        MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES  
        FROM:  
        Beth F.  Cobert  
        Deputy Director for Management  
        SUBJECT: 	 
        Extension of Policy to Provide Accelerated Payment to Small Business  
        Subcontractors

        Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-12-16, &quot;Providing Prompt  
        Payment to  Small Business Subcontractors,&quot; established the Executive Branch policy that  
        agencies should, to the full extent permitted by law, temporarily accelerate payments to all prime  
        contractors - with a goal of paying them within 15  days of receipt of proper invoices - in order  
        to allow them to provide prompt payments to small business subcontractors.  To support the  
        policy, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) created a new clause for  
        agencies to incorporate into their contracts requiring prime contractors to accelerate payments to  
        their small business subcontractors when they receive accelerated payments from the  
        government.  The FAR Council is also considering strategies that might be used over the longer  
        term to help maintain effective cash flow and prompt payment to small business subcontractors.

        The temporary policy established by Memorandum M-12-16, which was extended by  
        Memorandum M-13-15, is set to expire on July 11, 2014.  This memorandum further extends the  
        temporary policy to December 31,2016.  Agencies should continue providing six-month reports  
        to OMB in accordance with the instructions provided in M-12-16.  If an agency determines that  
        it may need to exempt itself from complying with the extension of this temporary policy, 
        it  
        should confer with OMB before taking action.

        As a reminder, the policies in Memorandum M -12-16 do not affect the application of the  
        Prompt Payment Act's late payment interest penalty provision.  Nor do they change the  
        application of OMB Memorandum M-11-32, &quot;Accelerating Payments to  Small Businesses for  
        Goods and Services.&quot;  Memorandum M-11-32 requires agencies to make their payments to small  
        business prime contractors as soon as practicable to the full extent permitted by law, with the  
        goal of making payments within 15 days of receipt of proper invoices.  These efforts should  
        include seeking ways to accelerate payments while simultaneously ensuring proper payments by  
        maintaining internal controls over payment processes.
