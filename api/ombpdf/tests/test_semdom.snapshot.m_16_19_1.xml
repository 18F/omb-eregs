        In 2010, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) launched the Federal Data Center  
        Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) to promote the use of green IT by reducing the overall energy  
        and real estate footprint of government data centers; reduce the cost of data center hardware,  
        software, and operations; increase the overall IT security posture of the Federal Government; and  
        shift IT investments to more efficient computing platforms and technologies.

        FDCCI.  FITARA requires that agencies submit annual reports that are to include:  
        comprehensive data center inventories, multi-year strategies to consolidate and optimize data  
        centers, performance metrics and a timeline for agency activities, and yearly calculations of

        security posture, achieve cost savings, and transition to more efficient infrastructure, such as  
        cloud services and inter-agency shared services.

            In all cases, the term “closed” for data centers shall refer exclusively to tiered or non-tiered data  
            centers that: a) no longer consume power for physical servers; or b) no longer house physical  
            servers (whether in a production, test, stage, development, or any other environment).

            Based on the number of data centers designated by the agencies as already undergoing some part  
            of the closure process, agencies currently plan to close 22% of tiered data centers and 50% of  
            non-tiered, non-cloud data centers, for a total of 44% of all Federal data centers. OMB’s goal for  
            the DCOI is informed by, but exceeds, agencies’ existing closure plans.

            By the end of fiscal year 2018, agencies shall close at least 25% of tiered data centers  
            government-wide, excluding those approved as inter-agency shared services provider data  
            centers. Furthermore, agencies must close at least 60% of non-tiered data centers government- 
            wide.
            <footnote_citation>32</footnote_citation>
             This target will result in the closure of approximately 52% of the overall Federal data  
            center inventory and a reduction of approximately 31%
            <footnote_citation>33</footnote_citation>
             in the gross floor area occupied by data  
            centers government-wide. Agencies shall prioritize the closure of data centers that are unable to  
            meet applicable PUE optimization targets and/or pose management or security challenges due to  
            age.

            The baseline number of data centers is based on the agencies’ August 31, 2015, data center inventory submissions,

            In the long term, all agencies should continually strive to close all non-tiered data centers. Server  
            rooms and closets pose security risks and management challenges and are an inefficient use of  
            resources. As such, although at least 60% of non-tiered data centers are required to be closed  
            before the end of fiscal year 2018, OMB expects that agencies will consider all such facilities as  
            temporary and work to close them.

            Within 30 days after publication of this document, OMB OFCIO will share with each agency its  
            individual goal for data center closures, specifying the respective number of tiered and non-tiered  
            data centers the agency must close. OMB may exclude from these agency-specific targets data  
            centers that are physically inseparable from non-IT hardware (e.g. simulation and modeling  
            devices, sensors, etc.) and that perform a specific, non-standard set of tasks (e.g. do not provide  
            general purpose computing or storage services to Federal facilities).
