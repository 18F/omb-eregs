        Scientific discovery, technological breakthroughs, and innovation are
        the primary engines for expanding the frontiers of human knowledge and
        are vital for responding to the challenges and opportunities ofthe
        2P1 century.  The Nation depends
        on science, technology, and innovation to promote economic growth and
        job creation, maintain a safe and sufficient food supply, improve the
        health of Americans, move toward a clean energy future, address global
        climate change, manage competing demands on environmental resources,
        and ensure the Nation's security.

        Federal government funding for research and development (R&amp;D) is
        essential to address societal needs in areas in which the private
        sector does not have sufficient economic incentive to make the required
        investments. Key among these is basic research- the fundamental,
        curiositydriven inquiry that is a hallmark of the American research
        enterprise and a powerful driver of new technology. Simply supporting
        research is not sufficient, however, Federal agencies should ensure
        that the results of that research are made available to other
        scientists, to the public, and to innovators who can translate them
        into the businesses and products that will improve all of our lives.

        This memorandum outlines the Administration' s multi-agency science and
        technology priorities for formulating FY 2017 Budget submissions to the
        Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  The priorities covered in this
        memo require investments in R&amp;D; science, technology, engineering,
        and mathematics (STEM) education; STEM workforce development;
        technology transfer; R&amp;D infrastructure; and scientific-collection
        management.  The priorities in this memorandum build on priorities
        reflected in this Administration's past budgets and priorities
        directives.

        Agencies should label the sections of their budget submissions that
        address priorities described below.  Agencies engaged in complementary
        activities should consult with each other during the budget planning
        process to  coordinate resources, maximize impact, and avoid
        inappropriate duplication, and they should include summaries ofthese
        discussions in their OMB budget submissions.  Agency proposals aligned
        with multi-agency R&amp;D priorities and demonstrating interagency
        coordination are more likely to be prioritized in FY 2017 Budget
        deliberations.

        In the FY 2017 Budget, agencies should balance priorities to ensure
        that resources are adequately allocated for agency-specific,
        mission-driven research, including fundamental research, while focusing
        resources, where appropriate, on the following multi-agency research
        activities that cannot be addressed effectively by a single agency.

              objectives of the 2012-2021 U.S. Global Change Research Program
              (USGCRP) Strategic Plan, as well as the complementary science
              agenda that underpins the President's Climate Action Plan.
              Agencies should prioritize activities that foster the development
              and use of actionable data, information, and related tools needed
              to prepare for and reduce climate-related risks and should
              prioritize investments that support technical assistance for
              community climate-preparedness efforts.

              <underline>Clean energy</underline>. The President has stated a
              goal for the United States to lead the world in clean energy. His
              Climate Action Plan outlines several key objectives in this
              domain that should be given priority in the 2017 Budget,
              including promoting American leadership in renewable energy
              (including manufacturing for these technologies and a modernized
              electric grid); unlocking innovation in other key clean energy
              technologies; building a clean and efficient 21st_ century
              transportation sector; and cutting energy waste in homes,
              businesses, and factories. In transportation, there is a
              particular need to support R&amp;D that can advance multiple
              transportation modes and fill knowledge and technology gaps. As
              part of this focus, agencies should also support technology
              development that has the dual benefit of reducing greenhouse gas
              (GHG) emissions and bolstering the resilience of our communities.
              For example, agencies might consider technology development that
              leverages renewable energy to power water desalination or
              purification - reducing the GHG footprint of drinking water and
              bolstering the resilience of communities in drought-prone areas.

              are instrumental to services that protect human life, property,
              the economy, and national security, and advance understanding the
              Earth as a system. Federal agencies should advance the goals of
              the 2014 <cite>National Plan for Civil Earth Observations</cite>.
              Agencies are encouraged to accelerate the development and
              demonstration of innovative approaches for observations,
              including technology for low-cost satellites and disaggregated
              instrumentation. In addition, space weather observations and
              R&amp;D are essential to address the growing societal needs for
              accurate and timely space weather information.  Agencies should
              prioritize investments in space weather science and preparedness
              according to the 2015 <cite>National Space Weather Strategy and
              Action Plan</cite>.

              art in manufacturing, as described in the National Strategic Plan
              for Advanced Manufacturing. Agencies should also prioritize
              investments in enablingtechnologies that benefit multiple sectors
              of the economy, such as nanotechnology, robotics, the Materials
              Genome Initiative, and cyber-physical systems and their
              application to smart cities.

              programs that support fundamental biological discovery research
              that could generate unexpected, high-impact scientific and
              technological advances in health, energy, and food security,
              particularly in the President's BRAIN Initiative, the National

              Strategy for Biosurveillance (e.g. , infectious-disease
              forecasting capabilities). Priority should also be placed on
              research that seeks fundamental principles that cut across
              habitats and biological systems, such as those that govern the
              behaviors of micro biomes in diverse environments.  Agencies
              should prioritize researchguided by the National Research Action
              Plan for Improving Access to Mental Health Services for Veterans,
              Service Members, and Military Families- to identify and develop
              effective diagnostic and treatment methodologies and metrics with
              the aim of improved mental health and reduction in substance-use
              disorders. In addition, the Administration has committed to
              launching the Precision Medicine Initiative, aimed at tailoring
              medical care to the individual patient. Agencies should support
              investments on improving interoperability of health records,
              addressing privacy concerns, and launching research that will
              enable discoveries derived from Big Data.

              addressing the immediate risks to our national security posed by
              climate change, handling large data sets for national security

              Data to advance agency missions and further scientific discovery
              and innovation while providing appropriate privacy protections

        must be fully justified and balanced against funding for ongoing

        Commercialization of Federal R&amp;D is therefore one of the core
        responsibilities of each R&amp;D supporting agency. Agency budget proposals
        should prioritize and highlight contributions to the Lab-to-Market

        using meaningful, measurable, and quantitative metrics where possible
        and describe how they plan to evaluate the success of those programs.
        Agencies should consider opportunities for improved measurements of R&amp;D
        activities and outcomes by linking management and financial information
        about R&amp;D in their DATA Act implementation plans. Agencies are
