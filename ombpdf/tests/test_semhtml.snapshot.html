MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES 
 
FROM: 
Tony Scott 
Federal Chief Information Officer  
 
SUBJECT:  Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) 
 
 
</h3>
<h1>Background 
 
</h1>
<p>In 2010, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) launched the Federal Data Center 
Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) to promote the use of green IT by reducing the overall energy 
and real estate footprint of government data centers; reduce the cost of data center hardware, 
software, and operations; increase the overall IT security posture of the Federal Government; and 
shift IT investments to more efficient computing platforms and technologies.<sup id="footnote-citation-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> 
 
</p>
<p>In December 2014, the President signed into law the Federal Information Technology 
Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA),<sup id="footnote-citation-2"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> which enacts and builds upon the requirements of the 
FDCCI.  FITARA requires that agencies submit annual reports that are to include: 
comprehensive data center inventories, multi-year strategies to consolidate and optimize data 
centers, performance metrics and a timeline for agency activities, and yearly calculations of 
investment and cost savings. 
 
</p>
<p>In addition, FITARA requires the Administrator of the Office of E-Government and Information 
Technology (henceforth referred to as the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer 
(OFCIO)<sup id="footnote-citation-3"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>) to establish and publish cost savings and optimization improvements, provide public 
updates on cumulative cost savings and optimization improvements, and review agencies’ data 
center inventories and the implementation of data center management strategies. 
 
 
                                                        
</p>
<p>This memorandum defines a framework for achieving the data center consolidation and 
optimization requirements of FITARA, the criteria for successful agency data center strategies, 
and the metrics OMB OFCIO will use to evaluate the success of those strategies. 
 
</p>
<h1>Policy 
 
</h1>
<p>As of August 1, 2016, the FDCCI is superseded by the Data Center Optimization Initiative 
(DCOI) established in this memorandum. 
 
</p>
<p>The DCOI, as described in this memorandum, requires agencies to develop and report on data 
center strategies to consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve 
security posture, achieve cost savings, and transition to more efficient infrastructure, such as 
cloud services and inter-agency shared services.<sup id="footnote-citation-4"><a href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup> 
 
</p>
<p>The requirements in this memorandum apply to all CFO Act agencies,<sup id="footnote-citation-5"><a href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup> including the Department 
of Defense.<sup id="footnote-citation-6"><a href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup> 
 
</p>
<h2>Leadership and Responsibilities 
 
</h2>
<p>All data center infrastructure and services, including contracts for third-party data centers and 
services agency-wide, shall be managed by the agency CIO in a manner consistent with 
FITARA<sup id="footnote-citation-7"><a href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup> and OMB Memorandum M-15-14, “Management and Oversight of Information 
Technology.”<sup id="footnote-citation-8"><a href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup> The agency CIO shall be responsible for implementing and measuring progress 
toward meeting the goals set forth in this memorandum. 
 
</p>
<h2>Transition to Cloud and Data Center Shared Services 
 
</h2>
<h3>Development Freeze for New and Current Data Centers 
 
</h3>
<p>Beginning 180 days after issuance of this memorandum, agencies may not budget any funds or 
resources toward initiating a new data center or significantly expanding<sup id="footnote-citation-9"><a href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup> an existing data center 
                                                        
 
without approval from OMB OFCIO.<sup id="footnote-citation-10"><a href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup> To request such approval, agencies must submit a written 
justification that includes an analysis of alternatives (including opportunities for cloud services, 
inter-agency shared services, and third party co-location) and an explanation of the net reduction 
in the agency’s data center inventory that will be facilitated by the new or expanded data center 
(such as through consolidation of multiple existing data centers into a single new data center). 
 
</p>
<h3>Consolidation and Closure of Existing Data Centers 
 
</h3>
<p>As previously required by the FDCCI, agencies shall continue to principally reduce application, 
system, and database inventories to essential enterprise levels by increasing the use of 
virtualization to enable pooling of storage, network and computer resources, and dynamic 
allocation on-demand.  Thereafter, agencies shall evaluate options for the consolidation and 
closure of existing data centers,<sup id="footnote-citation-11"><a href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup> by (in order of priority): 
 
</p>
<ol><li>Transitioning to provisioned services, including configurable and flexible technology 
such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as 
a Service (IaaS) to the furthest extent practicable, consistent with the Cloud First 
policy.<sup id="footnote-citation-12"><a href="#footnote-12">12</a></sup> 
</li>
<li>Migrating to inter-agency shared services or co-location data centers. 
</li>
<li>Migrating to more optimized data centers within the agency’s data center inventory. 
 
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cloud Investment 
 
</h3>
<p>Cloud environments are scalable and allow agencies to provision resources as required, on-
demand.<sup id="footnote-citation-13"><a href="#footnote-13">13</a></sup> Consistent with the Cloud First policy, agencies shall use cloud infrastructure where 
possible when planning new mission or support applications or consolidating existing 
applications. Agencies should take into consideration cost, security requirements, and application 
needs when evaluating cloud environments. As required by FITARA, agencies utilizing cloud 
services shall do so in a manner that is consistent with requirements of the Federal Risk and 
Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) guidance.<sup id="footnote-citation-14"><a href="#footnote-14">14</a></sup> 
 
</p>
<h3>Shared Services Managing Partner 
 
</h3>
<p>To support the shared services efforts described by this memorandum, the General Services 
Administration (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) shall serve as the managing 
                                                        
 
partner of the Federal Government’s data center line of business<sup id="footnote-citation-15"><a href="#footnote-15">15</a></sup> and data center shared 
services. OGP, in consultation with the Unified Shared Services Management office, shall 
establish and maintain a data center shared services marketplace and coordinate shared services 
for inter-agency consumption by: 
 
</p>
<ul><li>Coordinating with OMB to define qualifying operating standards for inter-agency shared 
services providers, creating guidance materials for becoming such a provider, and 
identifying and approving candidate providers. 
</li>
<li>Maintaining and monitoring inter-agency shared services provider operating standards. 
</li>
<li>Maintaining an online inventory of qualified inter-agency shared services providers. 
</li>
<li>Establishing an online decision support tool to facilitate agency review, selection, and 
analysis of inter-agency shared services providers. 
</li>
<li>Coordinating with the GSA Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) to create and maintain an 
inventory of acquisition tools and products specific to the technology and services 
surrounding data center optimization, including procurement vehicles for the acquisition 
of automated infrastructure management and monitoring tools. 
</li>
<li>Developing, implementing, and maintaining financial and service models, as well as 
contracts, pertaining to data center procurement with customer/partner agencies and 
shared service providers.  
</li>
<li>Providing a forum for participating and interested agencies to discuss the inter-agency 
shared services marketplace. 
4 
 
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this role, OGP will serve as a trusted agent and subject matter expert to assist data center 
providers and consumers of data center services by providing guidance on technology 
advancements, innovation, cybersecurity, and best practices. 
 
</p>
<p>All agencies will have the option of submitting data centers of their choosing for review by OGP. 
Data centers that OGP determines satisfactory in all of their operating standards will be 
designated as inter-agency shared services providers.  
 
</p>
<h2>Optimization of Physical Data Centers 
 
</h2>
<h3>Classification of Physical Data Centers 
 
</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this memorandum, rooms with at least one server, providing services 
(whether in a production, test, staging, development, or any other environment) are considered 
data centers. However, rooms containing only print servers, routing equipment, switches, 
security devices (such as firewalls), or other telecommunications components shall not be 
                                                        
 
considered data centers. Agencies shall perform a comprehensive review of their data center 
inventories and continue to maintain complete and updated data center inventories. This 
comprehensive review shall be completed by August 31, 2016, to align with the Integrated Data 
Collection (IDC) process.<sup id="footnote-citation-16"><a href="#footnote-16">16</a></sup> 
 
</p>
<p>Data centers shall be categorized into two groups: tiered<sup id="footnote-citation-17"><a href="#footnote-17">17</a></sup> data centers and non-tiered data 
centers.  Tiered data centers are defined as those that utilize each of the following: 1) a separate 
physical space for IT infrastructure; 2) an uninterruptible power supply; 3) a dedicated cooling 
system or zone; and 4) a backup power generator for prolonged power outages. All other data 
centers shall be considered non-tiered data centers.<sup id="footnote-citation-18"><a href="#footnote-18">18</a></sup> Private sector-provided cloud services are 
not considered data centers for the purposes of this memorandum, but must continue to be 
included in agencies’ quarterly inventory data submissions to OMB. 
 
</p>
<p>Agencies shall self-classify data centers as either tiered or non-tiered data centers based on the 
above criteria; however, any data center previously reported to OMB as a Tier 1-4 data center 
shall be automatically categorized as a tiered data center. 
 
</p>
<p>Under this memorandum, OMB sets closure and optimization targets that are applicable to each 
type of data center. Additionally, the terms “core” and “non-core” will no longer be used as the 
categorical benchmarks for OMB oversight. 
 
</p>
<h3>Energy Metering and Power Efficiency 
 
</h3>
<p>Agencies shall install automated energy metering tools and shall use these to collect and report 
energy usage data in their data centers to OMB. The March 19, 2015, Executive Order 13693, 
“Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade,” requires agencies to install and 
monitor advanced energy meters in data centers by September 30, 2018.<sup id="footnote-citation-19"><a href="#footnote-19">19</a></sup>  
 
</p>
<p>Consistent with the Implementing Instructions for Executive Order 13693 (E.O. Implementing 
Instructions), energy metering tools shall enable the active tracking of PUE for the data center 
and shall be installed in all tiered Federal data centers by September 30, 2018.<sup id="footnote-citation-20"><a href="#footnote-20">20</a></sup> The E.O. 
                                                        
 
</p>
<p>Implementing Instructions also advise that “[a]ll existing and new data centers shall have at least 
one certified Data Center Energy Practitioner (DCEP) assigned to manage its performance.”<sup id="footnote-citation-21"><a href="#footnote-21">21</a></sup>  
 
</p>
<p>Consistent with the E.O. Implementing Instructions, agency CIOs are also required under this 
memorandum to ensure that existing tiered data centers achieve and maintain a PUE of less than 
1.5 by September 30, 2018.  Agency CIOs shall evaluate options for consolidation or closure of 
existing data centers in which a PUE target of less than 1.5 is not cost-effective, such as through 
transition to cloud services or migration to inter-agency shared services data centers. 
 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, OMB will monitor the energy efficiency of data center power and cooling 
infrastructure through the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric. Consistent with the E.O. 
Implementing Instructions, effective immediately, all new data centers must implement energy 
metering capable of measuring PUE and must be designed and operated to maintain a PUE no 
greater than 1.4, and are encouraged to be designed and operated to achieve a PUE no greater 
than 1.2.  
 
</p>
<p>To the extent permissible under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), agencies must 
include PUE requirements for all new data center contracts or procurement vehicles. Further, any 
new data center contract or procurement vehicle must require the contractor to report the 
quarterly average PUE of the contracted facility<sup id="footnote-citation-22"><a href="#footnote-22">22</a></sup> to the contracting agency, except where that 
data center’s PUE is already being reported directly to OMB or GSA through participation in a 
multi-agency service program. Agencies are encouraged to require the same for extension of 
existing vehicles.  PUE reporting is not required for cloud services. 
 
</p>
<h3>Automated Infrastructure Management 
 
</h3>
<p>Agencies shall replace manual collections and reporting of systems, software, and hardware 
inventory housed within data centers with automated monitoring, inventory, and management 
tools (e.g., data center infrastructure management) by the end of fiscal year 2018.  These tools 
shall provide the capability to, at a minimum, measure progress toward the server utilization and 
virtualization metrics defined in the Metric Target Values section of this memorandum.<sup id="footnote-citation-23"><a href="#footnote-23">23</a></sup> 
 
</p>
<p>Any data center initiation, significant expansion, or migration project that receives Development, 
Modernization, and Enhancement (DM&amp;E) funds in fiscal year 2017 and beyond must 
immediately implement automated monitoring and management tools. However, agencies are 
strongly encouraged to implement automated monitoring and management tools throughout their 
data centers immediately.  
                                                         
 
</p>
<p>To the extent permissible under the FAR, agencies must include automated infrastructure 
management requirements for all new data center service contracts or procurement vehicles. 
Further, any new data center contractor procurement vehicle must require the contractor to report 
to the contracting agency whether the contracted facility utilizes automated infrastructure 
management, except where such data is already being reported directly to OMB or GSA through 
participation in a multi-agency service program. Agencies are encouraged to require the same for 
extension of existing vehicles. 
 
</p>
<p>GSA shall make available an acquisition vehicle for automated monitoring and management 
tools to support agency needs. Once established, agencies shall not issue new solicitations for 
these requirements unless they have developed a business case, approved by the agency’s CIO 
and shared with OMB, to establish that the separate procurement of these needs results in better 
value, considering price and other appropriate factors.  
 
</p>
<h2>Metric Target Values 
 
</h2>
<p>OMB will measure agency progress for this initiative using the following optimization, cost 
savings, and closure metrics and goals on a quarterly basis, by way of agencies’ quarterly data 
center inventory submissions. These optimization, cost-savings, and closure metrics and goals 
apply to all data centers at agency facilities.  
 
</p>
<h3>Goal 1: Optimization 
 
</h3>
<p>The following optimization metrics are listed in order of priority. Agencies shall achieve and 
maintain all listed target values by the end of fiscal year 2018:

</p>
<h3>Goal 2: Cost Savings and Avoidance 
 
</h3>
<p>Agencies shall, by the end of fiscal year 2018, reduce Government-wide annual costs attributable 
to physical data centers by at least 25%, relative to the fiscal year 2016 IT Infrastructure 
Spending data submitted to the Federal IT Dashboard.<sup id="footnote-citation-29"><a href="#footnote-29">29</a></sup> Agencies shall collectively achieve the 
following amounts of savings (combined cost savings and cost avoidance)<sup id="footnote-citation-30"><a href="#footnote-30">30</a></sup> in each of fiscal 
years 2016, 2017, and 2018:

</p>
<p>Within 30 days after publication of this document, OMB OFCIO will set individual cost savings 
and cost avoidance goals for each agency. 
 
</p>
<h3>Goal 3: Closed Data Centers 
 
</h3>
<p>In all cases, the term “closed” for data centers shall refer exclusively to tiered or non-tiered data 
centers that: a) no longer consume power for physical servers; or b) no longer house physical 
servers (whether in a production, test, stage, development, or any other environment).<sup id="footnote-citation-31"><a href="#footnote-31">31</a></sup> 
 
</p>
<p>Based on the number of data centers designated by the agencies as already undergoing some part 
of the closure process, agencies currently plan to close 22% of tiered data centers and 50% of 
non-tiered, non-cloud data centers, for a total of 44% of all Federal data centers. OMB’s goal for 
the DCOI is informed by, but exceeds, agencies’ existing closure plans. 
 
</p>
<p>By the end of fiscal year 2018, agencies shall close at least 25% of tiered data centers 
government-wide, excluding those approved as inter-agency shared services provider data 
centers. Furthermore, agencies must close at least 60% of non-tiered data centers government-
wide.<sup id="footnote-citation-32"><a href="#footnote-32">32</a></sup> This target will result in the closure of approximately 52% of the overall Federal data 
center inventory and a reduction of approximately 31%<sup id="footnote-citation-33"><a href="#footnote-33">33</a></sup> in the gross floor area occupied by data 
centers government-wide. Agencies shall prioritize the closure of data centers that are unable to 
meet applicable PUE optimization targets and/or pose management or security challenges due to 
age.  
 
</p>
<p>In the long term, all agencies should continually strive to close all non-tiered data centers. Server 
rooms and closets pose security risks and management challenges and are an inefficient use of 
resources. As such, although at least 60% of non-tiered data centers are required to be closed 
before the end of fiscal year 2018, OMB expects that agencies will consider all such facilities as 
temporary and work to close them. 
 
</p>
<p>Within 30 days after publication of this document, OMB OFCIO will share with each agency its 
individual goal for data center closures, specifying the respective number of tiered and non-tiered 
data centers the agency must close. OMB may exclude from these agency-specific targets data 
centers that are physically inseparable from non-IT hardware (e.g. simulation and modeling 
devices, sensors, etc.) and that perform a specific, non-standard set of tasks (e.g. do not provide 
general purpose computing or storage services to Federal facilities). 
                                                        
 
 
</p>
<h2>Reporting 
 
</h2>
<h3>Compliance Measurement 
 
</h3>
<p>Data will be collected quarterly on an agency-by-agency basis through the IDC, as follows: 
 
</p>
<ol><li>Agencies must continue to maintain complete inventories of all data center facilities, 
closure/consolidation plans, and properties of each facility owned, operated, or 
maintained by or on behalf of the agency. 
</li>
<li>Agencies must include progress toward meeting all optimization metric target values.<sup id="footnote-citation-34"><a href="#footnote-34">34</a></sup> 
</li>
<li>Agencies must evaluate the costs of operating and maintaining current facilities and 
develop year-by-year targets for cost savings and cost avoidance due to consolidation and 
optimization for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. Agencies shall report all realized cost 
savings and cost avoidance under the DCOI. 
 
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Strategic Plan  
 
</h3>
<p>In accordance with FITARA,<sup id="footnote-citation-35"><a href="#footnote-35">35</a></sup> beginning in fiscal year 2016, each agency head shall annually 
publish a Strategic Plan to describe the agency’s consolidation and optimization strategy for 
fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018.  The DCOI Strategic Plan and milestones described below 
replace existing FDCCI requirements for consolidation plans.  
 
</p>
<p>Agencies DCOI Strategic Plans must include, at a minimum, the following: 
 
</p>
<ol><li>Planned and achieved performance levels for each optimization metric, by year; 
</li>
<li>Planned and achieved closures, by year;  
</li>
<li>An explanation for any optimization metrics and closures for which the agency did not 
meet the planned level in a previous Strategic Plan; 
</li>
<li>Year-by-year calculations of target and actual agency-wide spending and cost savings on 
data centers from fiscal years 2016 through 2018, including: 
<ol><li>A description of any initial costs for data center consolidation and optimization; 
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>5.  Historical costs, cost savings, and cost avoidances due to data center consolidation and 
optimization through fiscal year 2015; and 
</li>
<li>A statement from the agency CIO stating whether the agency has complied with all 
reporting requirements in this memorandum and the data center requirements of 
FITARA. If the agency has not complied with all reporting requirements, the agency 
must provide a statement describing the reasons for not complying. 
<ol><li>Life cycle cost savings and other improvements (including those beyond fiscal 
and 
year 2018, if applicable); 
 
                                                        
 
 
</li>
