# OMB eRegs Style Guide

## Overview
The style guide is built on [Fractal](https://fractal.build/guide).

### Documentation components
The documentation pages are shown as "hidden" components, in order to use our custom styles. Otherwise regular Fractal documentation pages can only be styled with Markdown.

### Assets
The custom style guide SCSS file is at `static/scss/styles.scss`.<br>
All served assets are in the `public/` folder, where the compiled CSS file and images are located.

### Running the style guide
Compile SCSS:

```npm run build```

Run local server:

```npm run start```
