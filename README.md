# ATF eRegulations
This repository contains code necessary to run a Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ([ATF](https://www.atf.gov)) instance of
[eRegulations](https://eregs.github.io) (a regulation parser, API, and viewer). Live version: [https://atf-eregs.apps.cloud.gov/](https://atf-eregs.apps.cloud.gov/)

This code glues together general-purpose/non-agency-specific eRegulations libraries (which are not in this repository) with ATF-specific styles, templates, and plugins (which are in this repository).
