  control_key: AC-2   # Account Management
  narrative:
    - text: >
        Within the application (see cloud.gov for lower-level controls), there
        are no users nor sensitive data. The system only displays open data.
- standard_key: NIST-800-53
  control_key: AC-3   # Access Enforcement
  narrative:
    - text: >
        The majority of the application's functionality is read-only, and
        accessible to the general public. The ability to *update* data (i.e.
        write-access) is restricted via HTTP BASIC AUTH credentials. Combined,
        the user name and password are 64 randomly generated hexadecimal
        characters. For more details, see
        http://atf-eregs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production_setup.html#updating-data
- standard_key: NIST-800-53
  control_key: AC-6   # Least Privilege
  narrative:
    - text: >
        As noted above, the only "privilege" is write access, which only
        developers have (due to configuring the system).

  control_key: AU-2   # Audit Events
  narrative:
    - text: >
        Cloud.gov logs requests, failures, warnings, etc. emitted by the
        application. We also utilize New Relic, which registers Python-level
        exceptions and periods of down-time.

  narrative:

        In addition to the low-level reporting provided by cloud.gov, New Relic
        sends email alerts to the team after repeated errors or down-time.

  narrative:

        In addition to cloud.gov controls, all code is reviewed on GitHub before
        being merged into the "master" branch. These changes are tested
        automatically via Travis CI (which runs unit, integration tests, and
        static analysis). Proposed changes have appropriate justification
        (describing problems resolved or referencing further details in an
        issue tracker) in either their commit history or as part of the Github
        Pull Request. Proposed changes which fail automated tests are
        generally not merged. Only the tested, "master" branch code is
        deployed, on an ad-hoc basis.

  control_key: CM-6   # Configuration Settings
  narrative:
    - text: >
        As described in the application docs, configurable settings are
        defined in a handful of locations. Configurations which can be shared
        between cloud.gov environments are located in the manifest_base.yml,
        atf_eregs/settings/base.py and prod.py files ("prod" here meaning in
        contrast to local development). Configurations which are specific to
        one cloud.gov environment (i.e. either the staging or production
        environment) are located in the appropriate manifest_*.yml file or
        stored in and provided by a cloud.gov "custom user provided service".

        In addition to the controls provided by cloud.gov, the application
        tracks components through versioned library dependencies
        (requirements.txt), as well as a listing of relevant cloud.gov services

  narrative:
    - text: >
        Cloud.gov controls cover the majority, here. We also use a
        randomly-generated 64-character hexadecimal HTTP BASIC AUTH token to
        identify organizational users when updating regulation data. This token
        (split into two halves for "username" and "password") is stored in a
        cloud.gov "custom user provided service", from which developers retrieve
        the credentials before using them.

        . In summary, data is indirectly retrieved from the Federal Register
        and FDSYS (via the regulations-parser library), but passes through a
        developer before it reaches the server.

  control_key: RA-5   # Vulnerability Scanning
  narrative:
    - text: >
        In addition to cloud.gov controls, the application layer is scanned with
        both static and dynamic tooling.  Before being merged into "master", all
        custom code is automatically analyzed by "flake8" (a linting tool to
        catch syntactic errors), "bandit" (a security-focused static analysis
        tool), and a handful of custom, security-centric unit tests. Code which
        does not meet these standards is generally not merged. We also employ
        Gemnasium to track our dependencies, Code Climate to warn of potentially
        concerning style, and Quantified Code to warn about security and style
        issues.

        For dynamic analysis, we've addressed all high and medium issues
        raised by evaluating the application with OWASP ZAP and Nessus.
        Indeed, only two low priority issues remain and both are
        false-positives.

        At the application layer (see cloud.gov controls for lower), one
        selection criteria for libraries was their support status. Should a
        library fall in to an unsupported state, 18F has the capacity to
        maintain it in-house.

        Travis CI. Library dependencies are verified up to date via Gemnasium.
        Production errors are captured via New Relic and emailed to relevant
        parties. Further, code is first deployed (automatically) to our staging
        environment, where we may discover errors before appearing in
        production.

        is generally low risk, as it comes from a developer.
